SkyTrain Service Map Generator
==============================

A web app to generate an updated SkyTrain system map showing service disruptions.


**Note:** This project has only been really tested in Chrome Dev Channel. It
makes use of some ES6 features that should work in Firefox and Safari, but
there was a bug with SVG->Canvas->PNG conversion in Firefox Dev Edition.
